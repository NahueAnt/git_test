    <!--Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website is 
    located (/museum) as a museum, and each page on your website as a room in the museum 
    (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html). Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html 
    are directions from the current room (the museum movie room /museum/movie_room.html) to another room
    (the museum shop). Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https), 
    domain name (town.com) and the path from that domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html): https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html-->
